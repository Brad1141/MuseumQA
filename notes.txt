problem
- distilbert extractive q&a model for muesuem artifacts

Nov 5
    - turn pdf into database
    - could try splitting text into multiple parts
    - document retrieval
        - find tf-idf value
        - use dot product to compare simlarity

questions
- when was this artwork created
- what is this artwork about
- who made this artwork
- what is the name of the artwork
- what is the artwork medium

muesuem for training
- national gallery of art: had paragraphs of info about artwork

tiny roberta test run
- 3: Augustus III
- 2: the urban scene
- 1: eighteenth century

Ideas
    - good model: mrm8488/longformer-base-4096-finetuned-squadv2
    - Pdf: could be webscraped into a dataset with info on each artwork
    - get another dataset besides squad, only use questions with who, what, when created

datasets
    - mctaco
    - triviaQA (priorty)
    - super_glue multirc (current dataset in use)

super glue multirc

versions
    - v1
        - 50/50 data split
        - half specific questions
        - half general questions
        - base: longformer model
        - {'exact_match': 12.251655629139073, 'f1': 13.109500959726295}
    
    - v2 (Nov 20 submission)
        - include more data from other traning sets
        - focus more on the regex expressions
            - when, created, art
            - add composition, line/s, painting/s
            - add large context
        - build a base model training only on squad
        - use pdf to demonstrate differences in models

final essay new stuff
    - 1/3 special 2/3 normal split
    - added three new categories
    - base: longformer model
    - three different datasets squad1, squad_averserial, and super_glue multirc
    - used deepset/tinyroberta-squad2 for data creation
